In this problem, the goal is to train an AI that traverses an  n×n  grid to find paths that lead to the bottom right corner  (n−1,n−1) , from the top left corner, (0, 0). Assune  n=15 , and the terminal (end) states of the grid include the desired state  (14,14)  as well as areas with quicksand (death traps!). An agent gets a reward of 0 when it moves to a state that is not terminal, 1 when it moves to the desired state  (14,14) , and -1 when it moves into a quicksand. The game ends whenever the agent reaches a terminal state.
